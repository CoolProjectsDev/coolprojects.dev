{"pageProps":{"content":"<p>I know, its kind of a disappointment. The very first project, and it&#39;s the project used to show off all the other projects. But, it is indeed a cool and short project, so I compromised and put it on here as project 0.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s start from the beginning!</p>\n<h3 id=\"idea\">Idea</h3>\n<p>I always wanted my own personal blog where I could write about tech stuff. I <strong>also</strong> want to build cool projects all the time. So why not combine the two? This could be the perfect opportunity to finally fulfill my wish of a blog-esque website and my passion for building projects! I decided then and there, that&#39;s what I wanted to make. Instantly, I looked up domain names and wrote out some criteria I wanted the website to have.</p>\n<h3 id=\"criteria\">Criteria</h3>\n<p>First of, I wanted a <em>cool</em> domain name. Sure, I could&#39;ve put it on some subdomain of my personal website, but that just didn&#39;t cut it. Here&#39;s the list of my domain criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not too long</li>\n<li>simple to remember</li>\n<li>ending in <code>.dev</code></li>\n<li>available on Github</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every project I write about is open source, so I wanted a Github profile / organization with the same name to publish the source code to.</p>\n<p>Next I needed a game plan for the website. I wanted something simple, but not too simple. Sure, plain HTML and CSS would&#39;ve done the trick, but I always wanted to try static site generation. Long story short I was googling around for SSG frameworks compatible with my JavaScript library, React. After reading a bunch of comparisons, I threw a coin to pick between <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next</a>, which are both great for what I planned and it landed on Next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hosting\">Hosting</h3>\n<p>While I do own a server that most of my websites run on, for this website I wanted to do something new <em>(again)</em>. Instead of hosting the site on my own server, let&#39;s just put it on Github pages! I mean, the code is already on there and it can be automated with Github actions, so this seems like a convenient thing to do.</p>\n","data":{"title":"CoolProjects.dev","timeSpent":"3h","id":0,"publishDate":"December 28th, 2020","github":"https://github.com/CoolProjectsDev/coolprojects.dev"}},"__N_SSG":true}
