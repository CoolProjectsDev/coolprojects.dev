I know, its kind of a disappointment. The very first project, and it's the project used to show off all the other projects. But, it is indeed a cool and short project, so I compromised and put it on here as project 0.

Let's start from the beginning!

### Idea

I always wanted my own personal blog where I could write about tech stuff. I **also** want to build cool projects all the time. So why not combine the two? This could be the perfect opportunity to finally fulfill my wish of a blog-esque website and my passion for building projects! I decided then and there, that's what I wanted to make. Instantly, I looked up domain names and wrote out some criteria I wanted the website to have.

### Criteria

First of, I wanted a *cool* domain name. Sure, I could've put it on some subdomain of my personal website, but that just didn't cut it. Here's the list of my domain criteria:

* not too long
* simple to remember
* ending in `.dev`
* available on Github

Every project I write about is open source, so I wanted a Github profile / organization with the same name to publish the source code to.

Next I needed a game plan for the website. I wanted something simple, but not too simple. Sure, plain HTML and CSS would've done the trick, but I always wanted to try static site generation. Long story short I was googling around for SSG frameworks compatible with my JavaScript library, React. After reading a bunch of comparisons, I threw a coin to pick between [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/), which are both great for what I planned and it landed on Next.

### Hosting

While I do own a server that most of my websites run on, for this website I wanted to do something new *(again)*. Instead of hosting the site on my own server, let's just put it on Github pages! I mean, the code is already on there and it can be automated with Github actions, so this seems like a convenient thing to do.
